I don't know how much you had to dig for the all the information you provided in this video, but I definitely feel like this video shows that you can make a whole series that highlight countless other topics otherwise relegated to the pages of dusty old history books no one cares to turn anymore. To me at least, it's always felt like the events and people of the past, the stories  we read in our social studies and history textbooks are but bygone tales in black and white with little to no relevance in the present day.\\nWith so much western history adapted into numerous movies, TV series and informative animations, I had always wondered whether the dearth of such materials online in the case of Nepal was due genuinely to the unavailability of written records of our history, but through emerging channels like yours, I am beginning to think that we do, as a country, have enough information to produce massively consumable video content that has the potential to serve the public memory well.

He is rarely even being talked about in the present Nepal, despite being renowned as the first martyr who stood up to Junga Bahadur Rana after retiring from the old Gorkha Paltan.\\n\\nHe was a part of the Nepali soldiers who assisted the British Army to brutally suppress Indian rebels who were fighting for the independence of India. This was around 1857/58 after the Meerut massacre which gave birth to a military revolution against the British colony in India.\\n\\nAll of these incidents led Lakhan Thapa Magar and other revolutionaries to fight against the tyrannical rule of Junga Bahadur Rana in Nepal also. By 1868/69 (1925 BS), Thapa had already been promoted as the captain of the Nepal Army. However, he left his job along with his friend Jai Singh Chumi Magar in order to unite the people against the rule of Jung Bahadur Rana.\\n\\nWith the help of the local people of his birthplace, Thapa built a strong fort there and also built a temple inside the fort. He used to unite the people coming there to worship and make them aware of the arbitrary rule of Junga Bahadur Rana and his anti-public acts.\\nAs per the historian Padam Jung Rana, Thapa had gathered 1,500 people along with weapons and supplies to attack the Rana government. He wanted to end the rule of the Junga Bahadur Rana and to establish democracy in the country.\\nBut, Junga Bahadur Rana got the information of the revolution led by Thapa. Subsequently, Lakhan Thapa and his associates were arrested from Bungkot and brought to Kathmandu. They were tortured all along their way.\\nAnd, it was decided that Lakhan Thapa and his associates would be hanged from the tree in front of the Manakamana temple of their fort premises in the presence of the local people at Bungkot, Gorkha. They were charged with treason.\\n\\nAfter they did not beg a pardon in front of the Rana government, they were all brought to Gorkha. And, at first, the leader Lakhan Thapa was hanged from the tree in front of Manakamana temple inside his fort on February 14, 1877. It is also said that he has been skinned and hanged. And, after him, all other rebels were hanged.\\n11 days after his death, Junga Bahadur Rana also died in Borland, Gorkha.\\n\\nHe was the first Nepali to protest against the tyrannical Rana rule. Therefore, he was declared a martyr in 1999 by the Nepal government. And, the government declared him as the first martyr of Nepal on September 20, 2015.\\n\\nFalgun 2nd (14th February) of every year is declared as \\'Sahid Lakhan Thapa diwas\\' to commemorate his sacrifice for the nation and is declared holiday in some part of province 4 and 5.\\n\\n Such parts of the history must not be erased as it is tried to be done pretty much everytime something revolutionary happens.', 'Brilliant stuff.. keep going\\U0001fae1', 'Well done Ô∏èÔ∏è', '‡§ß‡•á‡§∞‡•à ‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£ ‡§ü‡§ø‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§à‡•§', 'Eagerly waiting part 2', \"The Rana rule was the longest and the  darkest years in Nepal's history for taking this country backwards a hundred years .\", 'What I think is they did it for party, sorry to say it was not actually for the country.

      "Dr CK RAUT: Anti-National or a Misunderstood Hero?? ['Thank you everyone for showing such  unexpected love & thanks to   the nepali comment team', 'I m a newar from Bhaktapur. We were totally unaware from the problems facing by our brothers and sisters facing in madhes. CK Raut was also portrait as a villain by the media and political parties.\\nBut through this video my perspective have totally change. All nepali should unit for a better and prosperous future of Nepal. Jay Nepal', 'This video has changed my perception towards CK Raut, actually he‚Äôs not a bad person as he was shown by the media and other political parties. Thank you The Nepali Comment, you deserve more  limelight. All the best', \"you are right. Most of us in terai consider ourselves Nepali. we were born in this land, we grew up the same way as the Kids in Pahad did, hearing stories of Prithvi Narayan shah, about all the dynasties that ever existed in Nepal and the development they did, about Gorkhalis and how our country never held back and stayed free. But we didn't feel the same as Kids of Pahad, unless we have ample amount of money. If you are from terai, you will not the get an item in a tourist shop at that cheap amount some Pahadi does. Why? cause you are from terai, so you are not Nepali, you are Inidan. But my whole life when I was in terai I never felt like any other country's citizen but Nepal. So, why did that women in that shop tell us that we are not Nepalis. What did we do? what did I do? since that day whenever we went outside terai, we lied that we are originally from Kathmandu just to get some discount and not to be treated like an outcast. \\nwhen foreigners interview some people of Kathmandu or Lalitpur for their Youtube videos, they say that Nepal is a very peaceful country and there is no discrimination at all. But it's not the truth, they know it themselves. They might be that guy who didn't talk to a Madhesi student in their high school just because he was from terai. ( I am just thankful, this didn't happen with me but I have heard stories and trust me I have heard so many of them). There is fear among some people I know. IF and when you are in Kathmandu or outside terai you may not speak in Bhojpuri cause then people around you will know that you are a Madhesi and you simply don't want to be left out because you are human too. Some of them happen to hate their original identity so much that they lie about it (But our country is secular so I can't object on what you want to be called as), they are so consumed by the pride it brings them from hiding their identity that they look down upon their fellow Madhesi. \\nThe world has to stop lying that Nepal is indiscriminatory. IF we might have ever felt like we are not Nepali, its mostly because of the way we were treated. Despite everything I still call myself Nepali and a Madhesi and am proud. There might be some harsh people who treat us like an outcast but we can't ignore the fact that there are some nice people, who I came across in my life, who never cared about the title of Pahadi or Madeshi and  I love them and i am glad they exist.\", 'We grew up in a society where we were taught that madhesi people are like indian. They came from india. Thus, they are indian. And we believed it so. But since the protest about declarations of madhesh to a new country happened ,it made me think about the reason and when I came to know this caused because of the discrimination that we do to them, it changed my perspective towards them.

I never understood why such a turmoil was created in the first place when I first heard of it. I remember feeling distraught at having people wanting to break away from their identity from Nepal.

Even after such awareness govt will need to prepare upliftment programs like quota system and prioritization schemes and inbuilt them in most of its activities (which actually is getting more unpopular in Nepal nowadays). The sheer amount of capital and human resource which the government will have to input in such programs is almost a dream in the current economic scenario. Even the richest of countries have been unable to completely eradicate discrimination amongst its people, so to expect a complete change in the nepali community within a few years or decades is foolishness. \\n\\nHowever the demand of equality and equal behavior is crucial now then ever.

You can not deny that fact that his movement was secessionist, and do you realize what laws around the world do to a leader of such seperatist movement? The most severe punishments are handed out to the guys like Mr CK Raut all over the world. \\nHim being highly intelligent has no bearings in this discussion.  Ask yourself this question, does it matter if a gunman trying to shoot you in the head is a noble prize winner in physics? No, right? That gunman is still a gunman and that shot will still kill you, does not matter if it was triggered by the most intelligent person on earth, or by a chowk ko  Rame/Shyame.\\nNext, if you did not have an angle in making this content, you would have asked yourself this question, even when the charges were so severe, we are talking about a literal seperatist movement leader, why was he repeatedly let out of prison, no matter how many times he may get arrested? Who was that powerful entity that was throwing their weight behind him so that Nepali officials never dared to press any serious charges against him, or even when there were charges,  our judges would acquit him when what he was doing was clearly treason against the country? Why were these foreign NGOs so active to throw their weight behind him? Why would he address the public, not in their mother tongue like Maithili, Bhojpuri, etc. but in hindi? There are literally hundreds of questions you could have(and should have) asked yourself before making this content. If this was due to negligence, then that would be understandable, but if it was intentional, then I don't know how to feel about this/you as a content creater.\\nNow, me saying all this should not imply that I am in any way against Madeshi Nepali people, or their cause. I would always support their fight for recognition, better opportunities, and dignity among other things. This CK Raut guy is clever. He knows that there is a great resentment in Madhesi Nepali people against the establishment in Kathmandu, he uses that discontentment to further his own notorious aims. He does not have the best interest of ordinary Madhesi Nepali folks in mind, he is just another foreign puppet who would gladly burn his own country and his people if that means he comes out on top in the end.

My father was brought up in miserable conditions due to early death of his father. He was married at 13 with my mother. My mother sold milk and agro products to educate my father with a hope that someday education will give them a hope to live. Indeed, Educating my father was a great step and has helped my family sustain in this new world. But, I grew up in unimaginable racism for being a Bahun that has shaped almost every aspect of my life. Nonetheless, I can understand that a lack of education is a cause for people to act unreasonably towards me. Lets not forget that Madesh is a place where innocent women are beaten till death just by accusing them as witches. Innocent brides are beaten and burnt alive for not being able to get the dowry. Women and children are thrown in brick furnaces alive for not following the same political agenda. Many people are just lost without anyone knowing there whereabouts. People are concerned about all of Nepal being overshadowed by this darkness which I would say is not just prevalent in Madesh, but all around Nepal where there is lack of education. Dalits are being made dalits to be able to secure that vote which can be achieved by just a couple of dollars. What about freeing the Dalits who have themselves accepted them as Dalits to get involved in identity politics? What about the sukumbasis who themselves term them as sukumbasis? What about the adibasi janajiti? Just research on the different types of identities that people hold in Nepal. A hero from Madesh who was tipped 1500 through a campain by the Madhesis looks like a small story. I wonder how many people with how many different identities have gotten through their lives in Nepal with a tip of more that just 1500 rupees from a person from a different identity?

I come from a government school and I know there is students in rural areas of Nepal who really, genuinely need good teachers. I am still woking on becoming the best at what I\\'m doing. At the same time, I hope there will be better policies and system regarding the education by those in power and authority.

It's not like committees for change weren't formed or they haven't tried.  How can it be changed? Who can change ? Unless the Governing Bodies are out of influence of national politics, greedy business minded individuals and have dedicated individuals for betterment of education, academic institutions will continue to stress parents (It's easy to say and everybody knows it).

As an educator myself, I have always been focused on the issues Nepali schools, public and private alike, have had in terms of what is the purpose of education after all, but this video was a good reflection of the businessworld of schooling. Something that haunts me about prominent private schools in Nepal is their connections with some of Nepal's big political leaders and their vested interests that keep public education from improving.\", \"Very well researched video I'm glad someone made a video regarding it, this is also one of the biggest factors why people tend to move to abroad, it cost more money to raise a kid here than  in first world countries, how will a normal individual raise a child here let alone provide good education(where public schools are not upto the level) with wage rate of this country, this education institution  is a business as a whole...especially in college level they don't promote their institution on the basis of what education what subjects what degree they provide but rather it's how much fun they can provide their students, the lifestyle and such which means fuck all compared to what the main goal the education institution should stand for.\", 'Your research is an eye opener.

Books after books, homework after homeworks; in between kids lose precious time to either be creative or follow their passion. Kids lose precious time doing homeworks and not getting enough time to spend with their parents. This leads kids to socially distance themselves from the parents but rather spend more time outside doing things that contributes to their personal development. Doing drugs and spending more time on the net brings in further distancing in the relationship between kids and parents. And ultimately breaks down to harmonious relationship. Dr yogi vikashanada of manokranti centre explains beautifully why Nepal's education system should adopt the model of Finland which lead to ultimately grooming kids who can tackle challenges of 21st century and beyond. We need to create people with better morals and ethics, so that we can have better statesmen and policymakers to transfer better deliver of services to ordinary citizens, where corruption is eradicated for good.

Traditionally, parental school choice took the form of families moving to a neighborhood with good public schools or self-financing private schooling. Contemporary education policies allow parents in many areas to choose from among public schools in neighboring districts, public magnet schools, public charter schools, private schools through the use of a voucher or tax-credit scholarship, virtual schools, or even homeschooling. The newest form of school choice is education savings accounts (ESAs), which make a portion of the funds that a state spends on children in public schools available to their parents in spending accounts that they can use to customize their children's education. Opponents claim that expanding private school choice yields no additional benefits to participants and generates significant harms to the students ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù in traditional public schools. A review of the empirical research on private school choice finds evidence that private school choice delivers some benefits to participating students‚Äîparticularly in the area of educational attainment‚Äîand tends to help, albeit to a limited degree, the achievement of students who remain in public schools.\\n\\nMeta analysis On USA \\n\\nA Meta-Analysis of the Literature on the Effect\\r\\nof Charter Schools on Student Achievement\\n\\nA meta-analysis is performed of the literature on charter schools and achievement, with a focus\\r\\non lottery-based studies and rigorous value-added studies. Overall, for the limited set of charter\\r\\nschools, locations, and years that have been studied to date, charter schools are producing higher\\r\\nachievement gains in math relative to traditional public schools in most grade groupings. No\\r\\nsignificant differences emerge for reading achievement. However for both math and reading, the\\r\\nbulk of estimates are positive. For math, middle school studies tend to produce higher effect\\r\\nsizes than other grade groupings. For math, studies that use lotteries or propensity score\\r\\nmatching tend to find higher effects than other methods. There is not a statistically significant\\r\\nlink between the years covered by a study and the estimated effect size, but for both math and\\r\\nreading the trend is positive. A tiny but growing literature on nonachievement outcomes suggests\\r\\npositive influences of charter schools on educational attainment and behavioral outcomes. \\r\\n\\n\\nChile \\n\\nThe quality gap in Chile‚Äôs\\neducation system\\n\\nMeta analysis \\nAbstract: \\nThe quality gap in education between Chilean schools with\\r\\ndifferent administrative structures (especially in the case of municipal\\r\\nschools and private subsidized schools) has long been a subject of\\r\\nanalysis and discussion within the wider debate surrounding the relative\\r\\nefficiency and role of public education. Unconditioned differences in\\r\\nthe results of standardized tests that point to higher levels of quality in\\r\\nprivate schools diminish when sociodemographic factors are controlled\\r\\nfor, but the question as to what control variables should be used and\\r\\nwhich methodology is the most appropriate, as well as the extent of the\\r\\nreduction, all continue to be a subject of debate. Here we undertake\\r\\na meta-analysis of 17 of the main studies that have been done on the\\r\\nsubject. The analysis shows how sensitive the results are to the controls\\r\\nand estimation methods that are used. In the aggregate, private subsidized\\r\\nschools score approximately four points higher than municipal schools do.\\r\\nThis is a statistically significant and educationally relevant differential\\n\\n\\nIndia \\n\\nMeta-Study of Literature on\\r\\nBudget Private Schools in\\r\\nIndia\\n\\nConclusion\\r\\nThe role of private schools in India‚Äôs education sector has been mostly undermined because of\\r\\nthe large number of unrecognised schools which continue to cater to low-income communities\\r\\nin the absence of credible state-run schools in different parts of the country. The learning\\r\\noutcomes of students from private schools, according to different studies, are either at par or\\r\\nbetter than the learning outcomes of students from government schools. The major takeaways\\r\\nfrom review of existing literature on BPS are:\\n\\nData used for education planning suffers from the gap of exaggeration of government\\r\\nschool enrollment and underreporting of unrecognized private school enrollment\\r\\n(based on incompatibility of NSSO data and government-published education data.\\r\\no 95% of increase in enrollment in primary schools was absorbed by private schools, but\\r\\nhalf of them are unrecognized and therefore not part of the reported statistics.\\r\\no There are supply side constraints in education, in terms of quality of government-run\\r\\nschools and access to these schools which has led to an increased private school\\r\\nenrollment despite regulation that is not favourable for investing in education.\\r\\no Regulations for private schools on paper are not consistent with market principles but\\r\\ndemand from parents has resulted in extra-legal regulations in practice which lack\\r\\nstability but somehow continue to provide outcomes at par with, if not better than,\\r\\ngovernment schools.\\r\\no Study of 918 schools in the slums of Hyderabad reports mean test scores for\\r\\nmathematics was 22% more and 23% more for students in recognized and\\r\\nMeta-Study on BPS Literature | Centre for Civil Society | www.ccs.in Page 22\\r\\nunrecognized private schools compared to government schools, achieved at between\\r\\nhalf and quarter of teacher salary paid at government schools.\\r\\no Lower teacher salaries, lower PTR and less multi-grade teaching in BPS but BPS achieve\\r\\nbetter learning outcomes than government schools or at par with them at 1/3rd of the\\r\\nspending involved.\\r\\no Starting English instruction earlier and more active teachers are primary reasons for\\r\\nparental choice veering towards private schools.\\r\\no BPS teachers are 2 to 8 % less likely to be absent and 6 to 9% more likely to be engaged\\r\\nin teaching compared to government schools.\\r\\no While overall gains for children in private schools are modest (1/4th to 1/3rd SD), the\\r\\ngains for students from lower economic strata are higher than those for students from\\r\\nupper income groups.\\r\\no Different studies conclude that parents make decisions based on what little information\\r\\nthey do have about local schools but there is clear information assymmetry which\\r\\nnecessitates a scientific rating system for schools that all parents can have access to.\\r\\no Hostility in policy circles towards private education in general, because it is thought to\\r\\nundermine the effectiveness of the state but Section 12 of the Right to Education Act of\\r\\n2009 (RTE) illustrates that the state has started ceding the importance of private schools\\r\\nin the education ecosystem.\\r\\no School choice program in AP show no significant difference in test scores of lottery\\r\\nwinners in Telugu and Math. But private schools spent 40% less instructional time on\\r\\nTelugu and 32% less in Math resulting in higher average test scores across all subjects\\r\\nfor lottery winners. (0.13 sig higher)\\r\\no The issues raised about the viability of budget private schools as a major part of the\\r\\neducation sector are mostly related to equity and partly to the pedagogy employed.\\r\\nConsidering that these budget private schools are still inaccessible to the poorest of the\\r\\npoor, the equity argument does hold some credibility. However, this would be true only\\r\\nin a scenario where no government-run schools exist. Thus, like some papers suggest, it\\r\\nmay not be in our best interest to pick one or the other at the moment and instead, we\\r\\nshould be looking at a system where both co-exist and compete.\\r\\nMeta-Study on BPS Literature | Centre for Civil Society | www.ccs.in Page 23\\r\\no It is important not to restrict the freedom of choice for those who can afford to pay for\\r\\ntheir children‚Äôs education while making sure that even the children whose parents\\r\\ncannot afford to pay, have access to some form of education.\\r\\no This model needs to be urgently considered primarily because of the costs involved. The\\r\\nmonthly fee charged by these budget private schools are much less than the per-child\\r\\nexpenditure per month incurred by the government and they deliver the same or better\\r\\nlearning outcomes.\\r\\no Therefore, if more of the government funding can be directed towards the poorest of\\r\\nthe poor who cannot access these private schools, it would be a much more efficient\\r\\nfinancial model which subsidises only the people in desperate need of it and at the\\r\\nsame time provides more choice in terms of schooling for parents.\\r\\no Thus, the role of BPS in education needs to be understood and what they have to offer\\r\\nshould be harnessed for the sake of all the millions of out-of-school children that the\\r\\ngovernment school system is still not able to cover if the goal of Education for All is to\\r\\nbe achieved.\", 'Mayor Balen shah should take action... and upgrade  public/government school', 'Nice video.

The study explores the relationship between each of\\r\\nthese school types and student outcomes. Additional analyses were done to determine the strengths\\r\\nand weaknesses of these institutions in a broad sense. The results indicate that attending private\\r\\nreligious schools is associated with the highest level of academic achievement among the three\\r\\nschool types, even when sophisticated controls are used to adjust for socioeconomic status. Students\\r\\nfrom public charter schools, however, performed no better than their counterparts in other public\\r\\nschools. Supplementary analyses indicate several ways that educators from religious and public\\r\\nschools can learn from one another.\\n\\nMeta analysis 2 \\n\\nComparing Public, Private, and Market Schools:\\r\\nThe International Evidence\\r\\nAbstract: \\nWould large-scale, free-market reforms improve educational outcomes for American children? This question cannot be reliably\\r\\nanswered by looking exclusively at domestic evidence, much less\\r\\nby looking exclusively at existing ‚Äúschool choice‚Äù programs.\\r\\nThough many such programs have been implemented around the\\r\\nUnited States, none has created a truly free and competitive education marketplace, being too small, too restriction laden, or both.\\r\\nTo understand how genuine market forces affect school performance, we must cast a wider net, surveying education systems\\r\\nfrom all over the globe. The present paper undertakes such a\\r\\nreview, assessing the results of decades of international research\\r\\ncomparing market and government provision of education and\\r\\nexplaining why these international experiences are relevant to the\\r\\nUnited States. In more than 150 statistical comparisons covering\\r\\neight different educational outcomes, the private sector outperforms the public sector in the overwhelming majority of cases.\\r\\nMoreover, this margin of superiority is greatest when the freest and\\r\\nmost market-like private schools are compared to the least open\\r\\nand least competitive government systems (i.e., those resembling\\r\\ntypical U.S. public school systems). Given the breadth, consistency,\\r\\nrelevance, and decisiveness of this body of evidence, the implications for U.S. education policy are significant.\\n\\nMeta analysis of randomized controlled trials  provide the most reliable evidence on the effectiveness of interventions \\n\\nThe participant effects of private school vouchers around the\\r\\nglobe: a meta-analytic and systematic review\\n\\nABSTRACT\\r\\nSchool voucher programs are scholarship initiatives ‚Äì frequently\\r\\ngovernment funded or incentivized ‚Äì that pay for students to\\r\\nattend private schools of their choice. This study is the first\\r\\nformal meta-analytic consolidation of the evidence from all\\r\\nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the student-level\\r\\nmath and reading test score effects of school vouchers\\r\\ninternationally. Our search process turned up 9,443 potential\\r\\nstudies, 21 of which were ultimately included. These 21 studies\\r\\nrepresent 11 different voucher programs. Utilizing a random\\r\\neffects and robust variance estimation framework, we find\\r\\nmoderate evidence of positive achievement impacts of private\\r\\nschool vouchers, with substantial effect heterogeneity across\\r\\nprograms and outcome years. Suggestive evidence exists that\\r\\nvoucher interventions may be cost effective even for null\\r\\nachievement impacts. Future experimental studies of long-term,\\r\\nscaled up voucher interventions could strengthen our\\r\\nunderstanding of achievement impacts.\", \"Heheh hami Nepali yo planet ma third class public hou.

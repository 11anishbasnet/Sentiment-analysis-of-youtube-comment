0,"What I'm going to say is that I never imagined myself as a member of the nation's finest team. We were already late when we began researching our four Martyrs. Because I was sick in the midst, I had to take a little more time to research. However, it put a lot of strain on the other members. They didn't sleep at night and didn't even talk with anyone.  We used to publish four videos per month, but this week we published three. The last segment that we posted today was practically sure to be unavailable today. We had almost given up hope. However, a miracle occurred. Normally, the render takes 90-120 minutes, however today it took only 45 minutes. I'd want to salute my team for their effort. I'm hoping for public support because the team has worked hard on this.",1

230,"For those who are confused why the Ranas were not able to kill Tanka Prasad Acharya, it's because in Hinduism, Brahmin-hatya (killing of Brahmins) is a very big sin. Hence, Ranas being devout hindus themselves, had codified in Muluki Ain that Brahmins can never be given death penalty. The only other people to receive the same treatment was the king.

This rule was changed later by King Mahendra when he repealed the Muluki Ain and codified anti-discrimination laws. However, opponents claim that this rule changed was done because King Mahendra found it very had to control dissent from Brahmin political leaders who couldn't be given death penalty.",1

0,"What I'm going to say is that I never imagined myself as a member of the nation's finest team. We were already late when we began researching our four Martyrs. Because I was sick in the midst, I had to take a little more time to research. However, it put a lot of strain on the other members. They didn't sleep at night and didn't even talk with anyone.  We used to publish four videos per month, but this week we published three. The last segment that we posted today was practically sure to be unavailable today. We had almost given up hope. However, a miracle occurred. Normally, the render takes 90-120 minutes, however today it took only 45 minutes. I'd want to salute my team for their effort. I'm hoping for public support because the team has worked hard on this.",0,im go say never imagine member nation finest team already late begin research four martyr sick midst take little time research however put lot strain member didnt sleep night didnt even talk anyone use publish four video per month week publish three last segment post today practically sure unavailable today almost give hope however miracle occur normally render take 90120 minute however today take 45 minute id want team effort im hop public

230,"For those who are confused why the Ranas were not able to kill Tanka Prasad Acharya, it's because in Hinduism, Brahmin-hatya (killing of Brahmins) is a very big sin. Hence, Ranas being devout hindus themselves, had codified in Muluki Ain that Brahmins can never be given death penalty. The only other people to receive the same treatment was the king.

This rule was changed later by King Mahendra when he repealed the Muluki Ain and codified anti-discrimination laws. However, opponents claim that this rule changed was done because King Mahendra found it very had to control dissent from Brahmin political leaders who couldn't be given death penalty.",0,confuse rana able kill tanka prasad acharya hinduism brahminhatya kill brahmin big sin hence rana devout hindu codify muluki brahmin never give death penalty people receive treatment king rule change later king mahendra repeal muluki codify antidiscrimination law however opponent claim rule change do king mahendra find control dissent brahmin political leader couldnt give death penalty
